<h1 id="life-is-not-fragile">life is <em>not</em> fragile</h1>
<p><small>June 29th, 2024</small></p>
<p>The scene was awful: a man slammed his car into a Long Island nail salon. 4 people died before the fire department could get everyone out. 9 others were seriously injured and 1 had to be taken to the hospital by helicopter<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the individuals interviewed stated that &quot;life is fragile&quot;. </p>
<p>What is this referring to? Us. People. Humans. We are not fragile. We are some of the most badass and metal animals on the planet. What traits come to mind when you think of our species? Our sheer will. Our ability to endure. Our intelligence. Is that fragile to you?</p>
<p>Do you say that when a woman is stabbed or a man is beat to death? No.</p>
<p>This phrase has been uttered many times with respect to gun and traffic violence: <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/life-fragile-dr-robert-lesslie-killed-sc-shooting-wrote-about-faith-blog-1582344">shooting 1</a>, <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/brandon-tsay-alhambra-lunar-new-year-festival">shooting 2</a>, <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2012/07/20/obama-after-shooting-tells-supporters-life-is-fragile">shooting 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/fort-lauderdale-deadly-scooter-crash/3244618/">&quot;accident&quot; 1</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.kwqc.com/2024/03/30/tampico-prophetstown-community-gathers-after-fatal-crash-that-killed-3-students/">&quot;accident&quot; 2</a> <a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/life-is-fragile-man-returns-crash-victims-hat-to-family-hours-after-his-death/69-e1f33933-fe9b-494a-bc7a-e3c5e6a05a16">&quot;accident&quot; 3</a>... These are the just top results. There are thousands more articles for either.</p>
<p>Of course this is mentioned in other contexts, but in these contexts, it is abhorrent.</p>
<p>We need to stop using this language. Humans are not weak. Guns and cars have killed nearly 100,000 Americans in 2023 alone. These scores of dead were not merely poked to death; they died in incredibly brutal fashion. Their internal organs were crushed by tons of metal traveling at high speeds. Bullets tore through their insides, causing them to bleed to death. This is horrific. This should bring tears to your eyes. </p>
<p>Even more sadly, these are the biggest causes of why our life expectancy is below peer countries. In other words, these scores of dead children are exactly why Americans statistically die younger.</p>
<p>This was my first article on my &quot;Wall of Bullshit&quot;. There will be more discussing even more bullshit. I'd love to talk about how the &quot;freedom&quot; that is car oriented development allows a few assholes to have an outsized impact on the rest of us or how pretty much any discussion around the housing crisis is rooted in lies.</p>

<p>I am putting quotes around the word accident to not disrespect the tens of thousands of Americans that die each year to what amounts to policy failure. We could provide alternatives to cars or not design our cities to be so spread out, but we don't. We could enforce traffic violations, but we don't.</p>
